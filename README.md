GStreamer OBS Studio plugin
===

1. An OBS Studio source plugin to feed GStreamer launch pipelines into [OBS
Studio].

This plugin has interesting use cases but may be difficult to understand and is
clunky use if you are _not_ familiar with GStreamer.

2. An OBS Studio encoder plugin to use GStreamer encoder elements into [OBS Studio].

This may be interesting for people trying to run OBS Studio to different platforms like the RaspberryPi or NVIDIA Tegra.

3. An OBS Studio video filter plugin to use GStreamer pipelines as video filters in [OBS Studio].

This may be handy to quickly get some simple filters in but also complex pipelines are possible as long as no rate or dimension changes are done.

4. An OBS Studio audio filter plugin to use GStreamer pipelines as audio filters in [OBS Studio].

This may be handy to quickly get some simple filters in but also complex pipelines are possible as long as no rate or dimension changes are done.

Prebuilt
---

Experimental prebuilt 64-bit Windows plugin is available. You still require the
official [GStreamer run-time] (MinGW version) to be installed. Make sure the
run-time `bin` path is added to Windows's `PATH` environment.

Experimental prebuilt macOS plugin available. You still require the GStreamer
run-time installed via [Macports] (not Homebrew).

Experimental prebuilt Linux plugin is available. You still require the GStreamer
run-time installed via your Linux ditribution's package manager.

Linux plugins can be installed in locations that follow this scheme:
```
~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/<pluginname>/bin/64bit/<pluginname>.so
```

[OBS Studio]: https://obsproject.com/
[GStreamer run-time]: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/
[Macports]: https://www.macports.org/

Usage
---

The source plugin makes use of the GStreamer launch pipeline descriptions. Please
refer to the GStreamer documentation to understand what this means:

https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tools/gst-launch.html

This plugins provides two media sinks named `video` and `audio`. These are the
media sinks that hand over data to OBS Studio. So your pipeline should connect
to these sinks.

An example pipeline:

    videotestsrc is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=960, height=540 ! video. audiotestsrc wave=ticks is-live=true ! audio/x-raw, channels=2, rate=44100 ! audio.

RTMP example:

    uridecodebin uri=rtmp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:bigbuckbunny_1500.mp4 name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

RTSP example:

    uridecodebin uri=rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

RTSP example with h265 decoding via Nvidia GPU and MP2L2 audio extraction:

    rtspsrc location=rtspt://admin:*****@*****.ath.cx:555/Streaming/Channels/101 name=bin ! queue ! rtph265depay ! nvdec ! gldownload ! watchdog timeout=10000 ! video. bin. ! queue ! rtpmpadepay ! mpegaudioparse ! mpg123audiodec ! audio.

RTSP H264 TS source with NTP sync and Nvidia GPU decoder example:

    rtspsrc location=rtsp://h264-encoder.local/main1 rfc7273-sync=true buffer-mode=4 latency=40 ! rtmp2tdepay ! tsdemux latency=0 ! h264parse ! nvh264dec ! video.

HLS example:

    uridecodebin uri=http://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net:1935/vod/mp4:sample.mp4/playlist.m3u8 name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

Linux webcam example:

    v4l2src ! decodebin ! video.

Linux webcam example with watchdog (automatically restarts the pipeline if the webcam stream crashes for some reason):

    v4l2src ! watchdog ! decodebin ! video.



If you don't understand what is happening in these lines please check the
GStreamer documentation as mentioned above!


Build
---

```shell
$ meson --buildtype=release build
$ ninja -C build

# optional for installing the plugin
$ sudo ninja -C build install
```

It will install into the obs-plugins directory inside whatever libdir in meson is set to.

E.g.
```shell
meson --buildtype=release --libdir=lib build
```
will install at /usr/local/lib/obs-plugins.


If you want it to install outside of /usr/local you will have to set a prefix as well.

E.g.
```shell
meson --buildtype=release --libdir=lib --prefix=/usr build
```
You can also make it install in your user home directory (wherever that directory was exactly..)
